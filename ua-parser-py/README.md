a ua-parser accelerator
=======================

This package is (currently) not intended to be used directly, instead
it is one of the native accelerators for [ua-parser][1].

The API is very simplistic and should be pretty stable (if only
because having to update [ua-parser][1] all the time is undesirable),
but there is no formal guarantee that it'll keep, as the goal is
really nothing more than a very basic export of [uap-rust][2] to
Python.
